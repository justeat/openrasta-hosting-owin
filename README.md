OWIN-OpenRasta-Service
======================

OWIN host for open rasta

Aim of the project is to develop the "OpenRasta.Owin" project. This project is a OpenRasta middleware to allow processing of HTTP request through OpenRasta.

=======================

The project OpenRasta Core NuGet but you will need the source for debugging only.

To test build the project Run the "Install.cmd" in the "OWINTest.Service" bin. 

You will then see the "OpenRasta OWIN Host" service running which you can then attach to for debugging and visit http://localhost:9000/.

======================
This is still in development and currently I'm attempting a spike down to a handler.
